;; Q: Write a procedure that demonstrates Carmichael numbers.
;; Those that fool the Fermat test.
;; Take an integer n, test if a^n is congruent to a modulo n for every a < n.

;; Test on 561, 1105, 1729, 2465, 2821 and 6601.

;; Two numbers are said to be "congruent modulo n" if they both have the same remainder when divided by n.
